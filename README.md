- 👋 Hi, I’m @kbetsonya, or just Katie
- 👀 I’m interested in data visualization, datasets, and database management systems. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Microsoft Power BI, SQL. I have intermidate experience in R, RStudio, and beginner experience in Tableau. Learning to become skilled in different data languages to start a career in data analysis. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with people also learning Power BI and SQL or people also looking to become data analysts.
- 📫 Reach me at my email or discord, inquire to contact. 
- ⚡ Fun fact: I like almost every music genre. Some of my favorite artists are Daft Punk, Santana, Pink Floyd, Hozier, Inner Wave, A Tribe Called Quest, and The Avalanches.
